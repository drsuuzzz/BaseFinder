This is due primarily to the fact that the various dyes have different sizes.  This effects the spacing between peaks and, thus, basecalling accuracy.</p><p>This tool is best used after <a href="Matrixing.html">matrixing</a> and smoothing (<a href="FFTPanel.html">filtering</a>, <a href="Convolving.html">convolving</a>, or <a href="Deconvolve.html">deconvolving</a>) but before <a href="BaseCalling.html">basecalling</a>.  <b>DO NOT MOBILITY SHIFT BEFORE MATRIXING!</b></font></p><img src="../../Images/mobshift.tiff"><p>Mobility Shift: Polynomial</p><p><font size="4" face="Lucida Grande,Arial,sans-serif"><b>Creating Mobility Shift Values:</b></font></p><p><font face="Lucida Grande,Arial,sans-serif">To create new mobility shift values, first click on the <b>New</b> button.  The mobility label will change to "Untitled-#", and a message will appear asking the user to select to enter equations by hand or to create by sliding traces.  Press the <b>OK</b> button after making your selection.<p><u>Enter equations by hand.</u>  Enter the coefficient values for each channel by entering values into the a, b and c fields.  By selecting the different channels, one can enter new coefficients corresponding to that channel.  When finished select the <b>Done</b> button.</p><p><u>Create by sliding traces.</u>   First indicate the channel to slide.  Then go to the data view window and click on the location you wish to slide.  A segment of the trace will be highlighted. Drag this segment backwards or forwards the amount you wish to shift.  In order for the tool to calculate the proper shift, do this at least three times with different data segments.  The amount of shift and the origin point for the shift is collected. Generally one data channel is chosen as the reference by the user and all shifts are performed against this channel. However, this choice does not matter to the program. Once the user has finished entering shift values, they are tabulated, and the equation shown in the panel is fitted to the shift values for each channel. Channels for which no shifts were performed are assigned a shift polynomial with zero coefficients. When you have finished sliding traces for each of channel/dye types, click the <b>Done</b> button (alternate state of the new button).</p></font><p><font size="4" face="Lucida Grande,Arial,sans-serif"><b>Renaming Mobility Shift</b></font></p><p><font face="Lucida Grande,Arial,sans-serif">After making a new mobility shift, it will be labeled as "Untitled-#".  It is a good idea to rename the mobility shift to an appropriate label at this point.  One does this by changing the name in the mobility label field and hitting return.  One can also rename a mobility shift whenever they choose.</p><p>Each time the program starts up, new mobility shifts start with "Untitled-1" and progress from there until the program quits.</p></font><p><font size="4" face="Lucida Grande,Arial,sans-serif"><b>Applying mobility shift</b></font></p><p><font face="Lucida Grande,Arial,sans-serif">Even if one has just created a new mobility shift, it still needs to be applied to the data.  One does this by clicking on the <b>Append</b> button at the bottom of the Tool Inspector.</font></p> <p><font size="4" face="Lucida Grande,Arial,sans-serif"><b>Removing mobility shifts</b></font></p> <p><font face="Lucida Grande,Arial,sans-serif">If mobility shifts are no longer useful, they can be removed from the list by first selecting the desired mobility shift from the popup list, and then hitting the <b>Remove</b> button.</font></p><p><font size="4" face="Lucida Grande,Arial,sans-serif"><b>Notes:</b></font></p><p><font face="Lucida Grande,Arial,sans-serif">The mobility shifts are stored by default in the directory:</p><p>	/Library/BaseFinder/MobilityFunctions</p><p>They are ascii formated files and can be easily copied.  If you have difficulty saving or loading mobility shifts, it is probably a permissions problem in either creating this directory or writing to it.</p><p>If you want to put your MobilityFunctions directory somewhere other than /Library/BaseFinder, change the Resource Path field in the Preferences panel.	</td>	</tr></table></div></body></html>
