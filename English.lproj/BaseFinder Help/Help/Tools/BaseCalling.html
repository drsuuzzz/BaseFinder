This involves finding features in the data which indicate which base occurs at each position in the sequence ladder.</p><p>Base calling is achieved by first creating a list of peak maxima.  This is then followed by iterative steps which determine which of these maximums are true peaks and which are false peaks.  This iterative stage uses peak height, peak width, and peak spacing to distinguish true peaks from false peaks.  After the iterative stages, the algorithm fills in gaps within the sequence.</p><p>The iterative stage modules work by creating a module specific calibration curve based on the most recent peak list, then calculating a confidence for each peak.  The confidence is generally a ratio of the observed feature of the data (height, spacing, width) relative to the expected feature (as determined by the calibration curve).</font></p><p><b><font size="4">Using the tool</b></font></p><p>This tool is to be applied last after all data preprocessing.</p><img src="../../Images/basecall.tiff"><p>High order is a variable for the spacing object.  When calculating spacing information, each peak must be compared to its neighbor to get a spacing value.  The high order value indicates the number of neighbors down stream which are included in this calculation.  For example if the value is 2, both the nearest peak and the next one over are used to calculate a spacing value for a given peak.</p><p>Height weight, Spacing weight, and Width weight indicate the relative weight of each of the feature modules.  A module can be turned off by setting its weight to zero.  In general it is best to keep each module turned on and equally weighted.</p><p>The iteration stage should stop either when the total average confidence of the peak list is greater than the Quit confidence level, or when the number of iterations exceeds maxit.</p><p>During the iterative stage of the algorithm, false peaks are identified and discarded based on the fact that they will have a low confidence value associated with them.  If a peak's confidence falls below the Throwout confidence level, the peak will be discarded from the list.  When the iterative stage is complete and the gaps have been filled in, peaks below the FinalOut confidence level are discarded.</p><p>Begin width tolerance and End width tolerance are used in the gap filling stage of the processing.  The width object is used to determine when peaks are wider than expected.  Often doublets or greater can blur into one blob without distinct maxima, but they still have height and width.  Width tolerance indicates at which point a peak is too wide to be a single peak.  For example if a peak is at least 2.6 times wider than expected, additional bases should be labeled under it.  Since blurring of peaks is more likely later in the run, both a begin and end  tolerance can be input, and the tolerance will be derived by linear interpolation between those two points.  Thus you can have this tolerance threshold change across the run.</p><p>In the gap finding stage of the algorithm, the spacing object is also used to determine where the spacing between peaks is greater than expected by the spacing calibration curve (i.e a gap).  Spacing tolerance is the factor by which this is determined.  For example, if the spacing between adjacent peaks is at least1.8 times greater than expected in that area, there is a gap there and base(s) should be inserted.</p><p><font face="Lucida Grande,Arial,sans-serif"><a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=8233787">Giddings, M.C., Haker, M., Brumley, R.L.
