Namely, it calculates the peak positions according to the size standard.  It also calculates the intensity of each peak which is then saved in an external file as peak areas. The identified peaks are redrawn with a bold line accompanied by the peak location in the <a href="../Windows/DataFileWindow.html">data view window</a>.</p>
<p>This tool performs best after <a href="BaseAdj.html">Fitted Baseline Adjust</a> (if not done by the automated DNA sequencing software) <a href="Matrixing.html">Matrixing</a> (if not done by the automated DNA sequencing software) and smoothing--<a href="Convolving.html">Filter Convolution</a>, <a href="FFTPanel.html">Filter-FFT</a> or <a href="Deconvolve.html">Deconvolution</a>.  Please see the <a href="../QuickStart.html">quick start guide</a> for some pointers on determining if your data needs to be processed by the above mentioned tools. In addition, the peak positions may be identified incorrectly due to mobility of the fluorescent dyes.  The <a href="MobShift.html">Mobility Shift: Polynomial</a> can be used to correct for the drift in the channels.</p>
<img src="../../Images/trflp.tiff"><p>To use the tool, specify the <b>low peak cutoff</b> values for channels 1 and 2.  These values indicate that every peak above this value is a valid peak.  Every peak below this value is invalid. </p><p>Another option to set is the <b>Cleanup Intense Peaks</b> option.  Sometimes the detector in the DNA sequencer can become overloaded and a peak will seem very tall and flat or with a strange dip in the center.  Some machines perform automatic color separation (see <a href="Matrixing.html">Matrixing</a>) as the data is being collected.  Matrixing of these intense peaks leaves some interesting artifacts behind and may also cause the dip in the center of the peak.  This option will attempt to correct for this and cleanup the artifacts and "unfold" the peak.<p>Select the appropriate <b>Size Standard</b> to use for your data. At this time only one standard is supported with peaks indicating the following base locations: 25, 30, 40, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 475, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950 and 1000.</p><p>Lastly, select the location and enter a name for the output file that will store the measured peak intensities/areas by pressing the <b>Save</b> button.  After the tool has completed its execution, the file will record for each channel (0 and 1), for each identified peak, the position in the trace, the interpolated base, the area of the peak, and the relative area.  The area for all peaks is totaled at the end.</p></font>	</td>	</tr></table></div></body></html>
