<p align=center><font size=+2>BaseFinder Help</font>

<p>There is not any extensive help available for BaseFinder . . . Yet.

<p>However, there is some context help available, which can be used by pressing the help key and clicking on the associated user interface element - you can see what you get!&nbsp; There should be some helpful tidbits gained in doing so - explore.

<p>An important reminder: <i>Without an appropriate processing script, BaseFinder will likely not do anything remotely close to what you want it to do.</i>&nbsp; You can define a script by first opening some data, selecting tools in the tool inspector, setting appropriate parameters, and inserting/appending the tool to a script.&nbsp; However, it will probably take you a very long time to learn what all of the appropriate processing parameters are.&nbsp; A better approach is to use one of the example scripts which should have come with the BaseFinder distribution you recieved and modify it as necessary.

<p>Also, remember, this is <b>beta</b> software.&nbsp; We request you report any and all bugs - that way we can fix them (though no guarantees on how quickly)!&nbsp; Send bug reports, comments, suggestions, and so on to giddings@unc.edu.

<p>Stay in touch - let us know any problems you're having, and how BaseFinder is doing for you. Also, keep an eye on the web site for the latest updates.
